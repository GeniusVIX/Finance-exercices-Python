* **Exercise 2:** Calculate the present value of $115 that you are to receive one year from now, given an interest rate of 8%.  
* **Exercise 3:** How much do you need to invest today to ensure you have $500 after two years if the annual interest rate is 6%?  
* **Exercise 4:** If you are promised $180 two years from now and the discount rate is 10%, what is the value of that promise today?  
* **Exercise 5:** Suppose you can invest money at 7% per annum. How much do you need to invest now to ensure that you will have $1000 three years from now?
